# GameOfBowens

**In the Game of Bowens, you either win, or you fly**

The **Bowen** is the unit of measurement of travel inconvenience, named for Richard Bowen, God of Travel Inconvenience.

Thus, a 1 Bowen Trip is one where there was a delay in one of the flights, but everything else went ok, while a 5-Bowen Trip might be one where a flight was canceled, leaving the unwitting traveler stranded overnight in DTW. Any flight that connects in CDG warrants at least +1 Bowen.

This application helps you calculate and track your Bowen ranking of your trips. We'll start with a web app, and possibly move on to a mobile app.

## The Rules

Your Bowen score will be incremented (and, occasionally, decremented) by the following rules:

* Delays: +1 Bowen per hour delay
